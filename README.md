The Kaldi open-source toolkit, developed in 2009 for automatic speech recognition (ASR), has played a foundational role in speech technology research. Its evolution continued in 2021 with the emergence of a follow-up trilogy—Icefall, k2, and Lhotse—demonstrating the rapid pace of innovation in speech algorithms and system design.

In response to the transformative changes in the field—such as the rise of large language models (LLMs), platforms like Hugging Face, and robust deep learning frameworks like PyTorch—this project aims to reimagine and modernize Kaldi’s capabilities to meet the emerging needs of the speech research community.

The primary objective of k2 is to re-implement all core functions of Kaldi natively in generic AI/deep learning frameworks, with a focus on PyTorch. This allows the seamless integration of cutting-edge developments in deep learning (e.g., novel optimization algorithms) into speech recognition research. The primary goals of Lhotse and Icefall include delivering efficient, user-friendly tools for data preparation, recipe development, and training modern ASR models.

### 🎨 GPU-accelerated Guided Source Separation (by [Desh Raj](https://desh2608.github.io/))
Improved implementation of [GSS](https://github.com/desh2608/gss) that leverages the power of modern GPU-based pipelines, such as batched processing of frequencies and segments. This allows us to perform detailed ablation studies over several parameters of the GSS algorithm. There are reproducible pipelines for speaker-attributed transcription of popular meeting benchmarks: LibriCSS, AMI, and AliMeeting.

### 🎨 Continuous Streaming Multi-Talker ASR (by [Desh Raj](https://desh2608.github.io/))
[We investigated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08555) Streaming Unmixing and Recognition Transducer (SURT) for continuous streaming multitalker ASR, and demonstrated the effectiveness of dual-path LSTMs and Transformers for generalization to diverse session lengths (recipes for the [LibriCSS](https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/tree/master/egs/libricss/SURT), [AMI and ICSI](https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/tree/master/egs/ami/SURT) datasets).

###  🎨 SPGISpeech (by [Desh Raj](https://desh2608.github.io/))
We developed an [Icefall recipe](https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/tree/master/egs/spgispeech/ASR) and trained models ([zipformer](https://huggingface.co/desh2608/icefall-asr-spgispeech-zipformer) and [stateless transducer](https://huggingface.co/desh2608/icefall-asr-spgispeech-pruned-transducer-stateless2) models on Hugging Face) for [SPGISpeech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02014), a dataset consisting of 5,000 hours of recorded company earnings calls and their respective transcriptions.

###  🎨 MGB-2 (by [Amir Hussein](https://github.com/AmirHussein96))
We developed an [Icefall recipe](https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/tree/master/egs/mgb2/ASR) and trained a model ([conformer-ctc](https://huggingface.co/AmirHussein/icefall-asr-mgb2-conformer_ctc-2022-27-06) model on Hugging Face) for [Multi-Dialect Broadcast News Arabic Speech Recognition (MGB-2)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7846277) challenge on Arabic multi-dialect broadcast media recognition.

###  🎨 Contextual ASR (by Ruizhe Huang, Mahsa Yarmohammadi)
Developed recipes for Contextual ASR. This is the process by which an ASR system is provided with contextual information derived from metadata associated with the audio, typically in the form of a list of words or phrases likely to be spoken, with the goal of improving the recognition accuracy of named entities and other infrequent terms. Our work on Contextual ASR is recognized for introducing the ConEC dataset ([ConEC](https://github.com/huangruizhe/ConEC)), followed by a method for improving neural biasing beyond shallow language model fusion ([Pull request - Neural Biasing](https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/pull/1763)).


### 🎨 Omni-temporal Classification (OTC) (by Dongji Gao, Paola Garcia, [Matthew Wiesner](https://m-wiesner.github.io/))
Training ASR systems requires large amounts of well-curated paired data. However, human annotators usually perform "non-verbatim" transcription, which can result in poorly trained models. We designed and implemented Omni-temporal Classification ([OTC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10389684)), a novel training criterion that explicitly incorporates label uncertainties originating from such weak supervision. This allows the model to effectively learn speech-text alignments while accommodating errors present in the training transcripts ([OTC w/ BPE units](https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/blob/master/icefall/otc_graph_compiler.py), [OTC w/ phone units](https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/blob/master/icefall/otc_phone_graph_compiler.py)).

###  🎨 ASR + LID (by [Amir Hussein](https://github.com/AmirHussein96), Paola Garcia, [Matthew Wiesner](https://m-wiesner.github.io/))
Created a multitask learning framework that synchronizes Language Identification (LID) with ASR, utilizing a neural transducer architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach on conversational multilingual (Arabic, Spanish, Mandarin) and CS (Spanish-English, Mandarin-English) test sets ([Pull request - ASR SEAME Recipe](https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/pull/1582)).

K2 brings data structures and algorithms from the field of finite state automata (FSA) into the world of deep learning. It provides efficient CPU and GPU implementations of commonly used FSA operations and integrates them seamlessly with PyTorch's tensor and automatic differentiation mechanisms, thus admitting - and benefiting from - the inner complexity of the speech recognition, instead of trying to remove it.

### 🎨 Hugging Face <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cca2970-4ff2-4847-b376-efda1bc17cec" width="25"/>
Researchers and developers increasingly rely on the open-source platform Hugging Face for pre-trained models, datasets, and tools to efficiently build and deploy AI applications. [k2-fsa](https://huggingface.co/k2-fsa) is available on Hugging Face. As of now, it has published one dataset (LibriSpeech) and 18 models. Additionally, 30 HF Spaces have been released, offering inference APIs and demos for tasks such as speech recognition, text-to-speech, audio tagging, and spoken language identification using Next-gen Kaldi.
